jQuery Rumble Plugin

This plugin creates a "rumble" effect on whatever element it is called on. A rumble
is a few shakes back and forth, great for grabbing a users attention to a flash message
or errors during form validation.

Options:
	- distance: The number of pixels to move on each shake (default: 4)
	- shakes: The number of shakes to do (default: 3)
	- Speed: The number of milliseconds to make each shake last (default: 100)
	- autoStart: Shake immediately or wait (default: true)
	- onComplete: Callback for when rumble is complete
	- axis: The axis to shake on (default: 'x')
	- shrinkDistance: If the shake distance should decrease throughout the rumble
			- This is feature is hard to notice on quick, short shakes. But for
			  wider shakes, it makes it a little smoother. An easing of sorts.
	- rumbleClass: The class to add to the element while it's rumbling (default: 'rumbling')
	- position: How to position the rumbling element (default: 'relative')
			- *must be 'absolute' or 'relative' or the CSS animations may not work properly

Methods:
	- rumble: Do the rumble
	- stop: Kill the rumble
